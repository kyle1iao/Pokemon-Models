# Pokemon-Models
This repository is for projects that apply data science, machine learning, and deep learning to Pokemon datasets. I grew up watching the shows and playing the games (Pokemon Platinum is the best one), and I am working on some projects centered around Pokemon because it seems like a fun way to practice and develop technical skills.
