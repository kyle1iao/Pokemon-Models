    "In this notebook, I do some deep learning with this [Kaggle dataset of Pokemon images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification?datasetId=410745&sortBy=voteCount). This data includes hand-cropped and labeled Pokemon images that vary from images from the TV show, to Pokemon card art, and anything in between. I will try to use this data to build an image classifier that can accurately predict what Pokemon is represented given an image. "
